Built a Basic Calculator with HTML & CSS (Frontend Focus)
Sharpened my front-end development skills by building a functional calculator using HTML for structure and CSS for styling.

This project involves:
1. Creating a user-friendly interface with HTML elements like buttons and an input field. Applying CSS to style the calculator's layout, buttons, and display for a clean and responsive design.
2. While this is a basic calculator, it demonstrates my understanding of HTML and CSS fundamentals, which is a valuable foundation for building more complex web applications
